## About

[This project](https://github.com/ishika-gupta21/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System/blob/main/FRAS_Project.ipynb) is a `python-based` application which provides an involuntary attendance marking system that operates without human intervention. The system can also be used to maintain track of employees or students or other instructional activities where attendance is critical. In order to be recognised, students or employees must also register in the database. The user-friendly interface allows for on-the-spot registration. Using an admin account and password, the organization's admin can email the attendance of the day to the respective email address. Only the organization's administrators will have access to the attendance information, and no changes will be made to the attendance details. In this project, we used OpenCV's LBPH Face Recognizer and HaarCascade Classifiers for Face detection and recognition.

## Setting the environment
 
1. Clone the repository or download zip
2. Make sure you have `python` version `>=3.6` and `pip` installed on your device before doing anything.
3. It is suggested to use an IDE such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab to run the code.
4. Download and install libraries mentioned at the start of the python file named 'FRAS_project.ipynb' using pip command.
5. Make changes in the directory path that is mentioned in the code, for the folders you wish to save the files and also upload the images.
6. Turn on allow less secure apps.
7. Run the 'FRAS_project.ipynb' code in all the cells and the tkinter desktop application opens.
8. Make sure you have good internet connection and good lightning in the room where you are using the `Face Recognition based attendance system`.
